We run [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) analytics on v2inv.com. The following information is collected:

- **HTTP Referrer**. We use the referrer string to understand the number of visitors referred to this website from links on other sites. For example: *https://github.com/*.

- **Operating system**. We use this to understand what operating systems people use when visiting this website. We only use the brand of the operating system and don’t include the version number or any other details. This is derived from the User-Agent HTTP header. The full User-Agent is discarded. For example: *GNU/Linux*.
