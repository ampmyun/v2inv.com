##### 你必须独立思考。我常常惊讶于：一些智商极高的人在市场上无意识的跟随大众。我从没通过和别人谈话得到过好的主意。

You have to think for yourself. It always amazes me how high-IQ people mindlessly imitate. I never get good ideas talking to other people.

##### 交易市场就像上帝一样，帮助那些自助者。但是和上帝不同的是，交易市场不会原谅那些不知道自己在做什么的人。

The market, like the Lord, helps those who help themselves. But unlike the Lord, the market does not forgive those who know not what they do.

##### 如果你发现自己身处一艘不断漏水的船里，换一艘船所需的能量可能比填补漏洞所需的能量更有效率。

Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.
